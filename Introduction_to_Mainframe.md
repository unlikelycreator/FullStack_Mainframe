# Let us define Mainframe
      - Mainframe is a highly secured Computer system designed to run continuously and process large workload at high level utilization.
      - Intake thousands of Input and process output application or user at same time. Process up to millions instruction per second.
      - Over 100 processors and 32Tb ram.
      - They are also known as Big Iron or dinosaurs.
      - They are central form of computing and not distributed.
      - Mainframes are used for Commercial databases, Transaction, servers, Application which require greater security and availability.
      - Eg: ATM transactions and Airline Ticket Booking.
      - One mainframe can run over 60 Operating System at the same time.

# Applications of Mainframe
      - Banks:
            92 out of 100 banks in the world use the mainframe.
            It process nearly 100% of all credit card transactions.
            Eg: VISA has to process over 56,000 transaction per second.
      - Transportation:
            Operating system name z/TPF is specially aimed at transaction based Business
            Operation.
            Nearly all Airline Bookings are done on a Mainframe.
      - Health:
            Insurance An Health Industries heavily relies on data.
            Mainframe is used to store analyze handle process this huge volume of data.
            9 out of 10 insurance companies in the world use Mainframe.
      - Stock Market:
            Mainframe can handle millions of shares are bought and sold everyday.
            Mainframe handle high frequency trading
            It is used to maintain client portfolios and financial data by financial institutions.
      - Government:
            The work include Citizen services, census data, Government Schemes data.
      - Other:
            Auto Manufacturing and Engineering, Postal Services, Energy Industries. Payroll
            Processing., Accounting firms.
      300 billions transaction per day.
      Where google does 3.5 searches per day.

# Manufacturers of the Mainframe
      - Only few companies used to manufacture mainframe as the development cost was to high. Eg: lBM, Hitachi, Siemens, Sun microsystems.
      - In 1960 and 70s the IBM sales was higher the other 7 mainframe manufacturers so it was known as IBM and the 7 dwarfs.
      - As of 2017 only bunch of companies remain in Mainframe Business.
      - IBM mainframes with 85-90% world market share. IBM's latest Mainframe system is zi14 Mainframe. z/OS operating system.
      - Fujitsu Mainframes are popular in Europe. BS2000 OS
      - Unisys Mainframes have 15% market share in Asia/Pacific region. It is market leader in South America and Taiwan. Clear path forward (latest Mainframe) OS2200 Os
      - HP also manutacture mainframe, Non-stop (latest Mainframe)
      - Bull also manutactures maintrame,  Nova sale (latest Mainframe)
      - IBM z/0S has JCL (Job control Language as scripting language. Others use WFL or ECL.

# History of IBM
      - 1950 1BM released 700 series mainframes Vacuum Tubes mainframes. These mainframes are called First generation mainframes.
      - Earlier Mainframe had no OS. Business have to develop their own OS to use them.
      - Different mainframes for various sectors hence incompatible with each other.
      - Later 1BM made 7000 series. A Transistor based mainframe, Called Second Generation Mainframe.
      - In 1964 1BM released SYSTEM 360 called Third Gen Mainframe.
      - Users can buy small mainframe and upgrade to bigger one
      - Gene Amdahl was the chief architect of SYSTEM 360.
          - 1980's -> 3081, 3090
          - 1990's -> SYSTEM 360
          - 2000's-> z series
      - Latest 1BM z15 mainframe and IDM LinuxOne which runs on Linux was launched in 2015.

# Let is define IBM System 360
      - Separate branch for various Industries
      - Each Branch is incompatible with one another.
      - Earlier Mainframes were without OS and businesses have to develop their own
      - OS and applications. Therefore Application written for one mainframe has to be rewritten to run on another.
      - In 1964 1BM released System/360 it was known 360 because of 360 uses. it was first standardize mainframe hardware and software. It was known as general purpose Computer.
      - 1BM mainframes were used in Apollo 11 missions.

# Overview of Mainframe features
      - Reliability:
            - Mainframe has ability to correct its error in its hardware components.
            - Meantime Failure is 40 years. Thus mainframe can run years without any error.
            - Examples ATM's run 24/7. Give correct output for each user long period of time.
      - Availability:
            - Mainframe can recover from tailed component withou
            any impact on running system.
            Thus system keeps operating system in the case of
            component tailure.
            - Mainframe companies boost of 99.999% of availability.
      - Serviceability:
            Mainframe determine the reason why the failure
            occur so it can be repaired easily and maintained.
            This Called RAS(Reliability, Availability, Serviceability)
            together.
      - Scalability:
            - The computation power can be scaled based on
            business requirement.
            - More processor can be added without shutting down
            the system.
      - Compatibility:
            - They have ability to run applications successfully on
            different models of system.
            Program written on old system can run on the new
            system.
            - When compatibility will be unavoidable users will be
            informed in adyanced.

      
# Mainframe Operating System
      - Mainframe can run multiple operating systems
      - In 1964 released System/360's mainframe.
      - There were the general purpose Computers usable by all industries.
      - One family of Operating Systems has many different OS within it.
      Example:
          - ACP-Airline Control Operating System.
          - DOS/360- Disk Operating system
          - TSS/360 - Time Sharing Operating System.
          - CP/67- Virtual Machine and few more.
          Current OS is Z-series with Z/OS Operating Systems.
          
# Languages used in Mainframe
      - Scripting Language: JCL (Job Control Language).
      - Application Language: Cobol, FORTRAN, C, C++, Java, REXX. Etc.
      - Since we run Linux on a mainframe, we can access pretty much any Language.
      - CICs (Customer Information Control System) - Used for Frontend of the Mainframe.
      - Databases - DB2, IMS, uses SQL queries.
      - File Access Method: VSAM.
      - OS: Z/OS, Linux.
      
# Types of Data Processing in Mainframe
      - There are two types of Data processing:
            - Batch Processing8
            - Online Transaction Processing
      - Batch Processing:
            - Batch Operation process without any user Interaction.
            - A batch Job is submitted on a computer the job reads and processes the data in bulk and produce output.
            - Eg: Monthly Bank Statement.
              - JOB A-Calculate total monthly withdrawal.
              - JOB B-Calculate money deposits.
              - Job C-Calculate total balance
      - Online Transaction Processing:
            - It occurs interactively with the end user.
            - Uses ClIcs (Customer information Control System).
            - Eg: Money withdrawal from ATM, Booking airplane tickets.
      
# Introduction to Batch Process
      - Execution of set of programs without manual intervention.
        Eg: Instagram Upload Images.
          - Uploaded Images need to be compressed to be stored in large databases so a time slot is allocated to do this called s Batch Window
          - A Batch Window: A time slot where online activity is less intensive. So midnight will be considered as Batch window to do so.
